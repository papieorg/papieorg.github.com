<!--============-->


<p class="bold12Blue">What is PiE?</p>


<p class="body10">Palo Alto Partners in Education (PiE) is the only non-profit educational foundation devoted
    exclusively to raising money for all Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) schools, and the only foundation
    dedicated to raising funds to pay for PAUSD teachers and staff. We work with parents, the school district, and
    the community to give all students the best education possible. PiE is the district’s essential partner in providing
    support and enrichment opportunities that help every child receive a well-rounded, fulfilling education from PAUSD.
    We
    distribute funds on an equal per-pupil basis at each school level throughout the district. </p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">Who runs PiE?</p>

<p class="body10">
    PiE is a non-profit educational foundation run by a <a href="BOD.html">Board of Directors</a> of
    dedicated parent volunteers with professional expertise in a variety of areas, including fundraising, finance,
    development, business, and marketing. Strong
    supporters of Palo Alto's public schools, PiE Board Members understand that a public education is free, but a great
    education
    is not. PiE employs a full-time Executive Director, Kathy Schroeder, as well as two part-time staff members. They
    can
    be reached in the PiE office at 650-329-3990 or by sending email to Kathy at
    <a href="mailto:kschroeder@papie.org">kschroeder@papie.org</a>.

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">What are PiE's fundraising goals for the 2012-2013
    campaign?</p>

<p class="body10">PiE's goal for the 2012-2013 Schools Campaign is to raise the funds needed to support critical
    staffing and programs at Palo Alto schools. PiE hopes to raise $4.75 million for the Palo Alto Unified School
    District, an 8% increase from last year's donation of $4.4 million, made possible by generous donors. In addition to
    the large grant, PiE's goal for teacher grants remains at $100,000. Each year, we work closely with PAUSD to set
    PiE’s fundraising goals, in order to mitigate budget cuts and to ensure continued excellence across district
    schools. The funds we raise support carefully chosen target areas at each school level. (Click
    <a href="Fundraising_targets.html">here</a> for more detailed information about PiE target areas.)</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>


<p class="bold12Blue">Why should I contribute to PiE?</p>

<p class="body10">Gifts to PiE are essential to preserve an outstanding education at PAUSD. PiE dollars now make up 75%
    of the flexible funding that PAUSD principals can spend at each school for school-specific support and enrichment
    not made possible
    by district allocations. These dollars fund classroom aides, arts, and science in elementary schools; teacher
    coaches, counselors, and electives enrichment in middle schools; and student guidance, college and career
    counseling, and elective enrichment in high schools. </p>

<p class="body10">To find out how PiE funds are being spent at your school, click <a
        href="../02_OurImpact/SchoolCampaign.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">How are PiE's operations overseen?</p>

<p class="body10">
    PiE is starting its eighth year as a trusted partner of parents and of the school district. PiE is run by an
    Executive Director and two part-time staff members, who are all district parents. They report to a 23-member Board
    of Directors. Each director has the personal and fiduciary responsibility to ensure that PiE is run ethically and
    all finances are reported accurately.


</p>

<p class="body10">
    In addition, every year, PiE’s financial statements are audited by an outside third party for accuracy and
    completeness;
    for the 2011-12 school year the audit was conducted by Robert Lee and Associates, LLP, of San Jose, California.</p>

<p class="body10">For a copy of PiE’s audited financials, please write to Executive Director Kathy Schroeder at
    <a href="mailto:kschroeder@papie.org">kschroeder@papie.org</a>.
</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>


<p class="bold12Blue">Why do I need to give at all? Aren't public schools supposed to be free?</p>

<p class="body10">Public financing alone can no longer provide the high quality education we expect in this community.
    In order to maintain and build upon the academic excellence of PAUSD schools, which draws families to Palo Alto
    schools neighborhoods and keeps property values high, the community must seek additional funding.
</p>

<p class="body10">California's ranking on per-student spending on education has steadily decreased since the passage of
    Proposition 13, a consequence of the state's tax-reform efforts. Two types of school classifications resulted from
    this funding reduction: Basic Aid and Revenue Limited. Revenue Limited districts do not raise enough taxes locally
    to meet the state minimums and therefore receive funding from the state based on the number of students enrolled.
    Basic Aid districts (such as Palo Alto) are perceived to have enough local tax revenue to meet minimum school
    funding and, thus, receive relatively little state funding.
</p>

<p class="body10">
    As a Basic Aid district, we must rely on the generosity of local donors and ballot measures, in addition to federal
    and state funding, to augment property taxes and support the school district's high standards of excellence.
</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">Why does PiE not allow me to give just to my individual school(s)?</p>
<p class="body10">
In 2002, PAUSD made a School Board Policy decision to only allow a central fundraising organization to pay for
supplemental staffing at PAUSD schools. (Please see <a href="http://pausd.org/community/board/Policies/downloads/BP1260.01_K12_staffing.pdf">
K-12 Staffing Policy</a> for further details.)  PiE's predecessor organization was created to respond to this ruling
and to provide a means for parents to donate to support staffing at schools in an equitable way, as the district
intended.  This "equal funding for all schools" principle is a cornerstone value of PiE and of the district we
support.  PiE cannot change this approach.</p>

<p class="body10">Since donations come from participation by many families at all schools and
then are allocated to all schools, most donors would find that their
donations effectively do stay at their own school, augmented by gifts from
foundations, businesses and other community donors. </p>


<p class="body10">


</p>


<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">Is it true that PAUSD has a surplus? If so, why is PiE still
    asking for money?</p>


<p class="body10">PAUSD has won repeated awards for its outstanding financial management from the state. The district is
    required by law to maintain a healthy and substantial reserve to cover unforeseen expenses and shortfalls during
    fiscally challenging times. Superintendent Skelly has told the community that the reserve will be drawn down over
    the next few years as state and federal finances get tighter. Unfortunately, even with this surplus, the kind of
    educational program Palo
    Alto schools offer is no longer free to our community. PiE funds the important programs that the district can no
    longer
    support and needs donations to preserve crucial staff like aides, counselors, electives and others. Your donations
    and the donations of all community members allow Palo Alto schools to continue to offer the enriched education that
    many other school districts have been forced to cut in recent years.</p>


<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">
    I understand there are some initiatives on the November election ballot that may affect schools. How will these
    impact PAUSD and PiE?
</p>

<p class="body10">

    Two initiatives to provide additional funding for schools have been placed on the November Ballot. One initiative,
    called Our Children Our Future, is co-sponsored by the PTA. The other, written by the Governor’s office, is
    co-sponsored by the California Teachers Association. Either of these initiatives will be helpful in avoiding cuts to
    schools. California continues to face budget challenges resulting in shrinking budgets available to schools. PiE
    does not advocate for any individual measure, but hopes to avoid the large cuts that PAUSD may face (currently
    projected at over $5 million mid-year) if both initiatives fail.


</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">How will my contribution impact my child?</p>


<p class="body10">PiE is committed to an equitable distribution of funds across district schools on a per-pupil basis
    per school level, so that all students benefit. In the spring PiE sets its target goals for the following year,
    together with each school principal, parents (through market research), and with input from the district. Once these
    targets are set, principals work with their school communities to allocate dollars appropriately. PiE dollars
    directly support
    staff members that enrich education at the individual school level and support broader educational priorities set
    forth by the district's strategic plan. In addition, in the event of severe cuts from the state, some PiE funds may
    be used to alleviate teacher layoffs or to preserve programs or staff that would otherwise be cut. PiE donations can
    be directed towards elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, or remain unrestricted. Specific PiE target
    areas for 2012-13 include:

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">I just gave to PiE, should I also support my PTA?</p>

<p class="body10">Yes!&nbsp; Both are critical funding sources for local schools.</p>

<p class="body10">PiE supports vital school "staff" and is the only fund raising organization permitted by the Palo Alto
    Board of Education to pay for salaries during the school day, allowing for in-class support such as classroom aides,
    arts instructors, and science specialists at the elementary school level; student counselors, teacher coaches and
    elective teachers at the middle school level; and college, career and guidance counselors, and elective staff at the
    high school level.
</p>

<p class="body10">The PTA supports "stuff" such as classroom enrichment and supplies, school site improvements,
    playground equipment, student scholarships for field trips, and site-specific programs such as assemblies and
    parent-run community-building activities.
</p>

<p class="body10">PiE and PTA are a crucial part of the “funding puzzle” that the district must assemble every year to
    keep PAUSD schools strong.

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">How much should I give?</p>


<p class="body10">To raise the funds we have been asked to raise for PAUSD, we are asking every family to give $800 per
    child enrolled in school. By comparison, suggested donations from neighboring school districts are: San Carlos:
    $1,000 per child; Los Altos: $1,200 per child; Menlo Park: $1,500 per child; and Las Lomitas: $2,000 per child. We
    set a recommended dollar amount that enables PiE to meet its target goals and fund essential staffing needs across
    the Palo Alto Unified School District.
</p>

<p class="body10">This suggested donation is neither a minimum nor a maximum; we're asking you to give what you can but
    to consider an amount that is significant to your family. If you can double your gift from last year, you will help
    us reach the higher goals. If you can join our <a href="../03_Donate/LeadershipCircle.html">
        Leadership Circle</a> for $2,500 or more per family, you will join the hundreds of families who give a premium
    to public education in PAUSD. If you can only give $200, you will fund several hours of aide time. Regardless of
    the amount, every donation is appreciated and well-spent.
</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">What is PiE’s Expense Ratio? </p>

<p class="body10">For 2011-12, PiE spent 6.5% on expenses. All other funds flowed to PAUSD schools.
</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">When should I donate? Should I wait for a Challenge Grant or
    Donation Days?</p>

<p class="body10">PiE’s 2012-13 Schools Campaign runs from mid-August, 2012 to January 25, 2013. While donations are
    welcome anytime, we hope to raise as much money as possible early in the school year because of the great
    uncertainty facing school budgets. PiE’s first Back to School Challenge Grant ends September 7, 2012, and will match
    any amount you can give up to a total of $300,000. This challenge grant is pledged by generous PAUSD families who
    are looking to inspire our donors to impact our schools even more with their gifts. Donations made early in the year
    help build momentum and provide the foundation for a successful campaign, so we especially welcome gifts made early
    in the campaign! Whenever you choose to give, please know that your gift will be used and valued. </p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">Is my donation tax deductible?</p>

<p class="body10">Yes, to the full extent allowed by law. Palo Alto Partners in Education is a 501 (c)(3), non-profit

<p class="bold12Blue">What about company matching programs?</p>

<p class="body10">

<p class="body10">Many employers offer matching donation programs to encourage employees to contribute to charitable
    organizations. Some companies match your contribution dollar for dollar, while others will double or even triple the
    amount of your donation. Generally, employees can initiate the matching contribution by requesting and completing a
    form provided by the company website or HR department. To search for your company, please click
    <a href="http://www.matchinggift.com/papie/">here</a>. Palo Alto
    Partners in Education's EIN (Tax I.D. #) is: 77-0186364.

<p class="body10">For more information, please contact Executive Director Kathy Schroeder in the PiE district office at
    650-329-3990 or <a href="mailto:info@papie.org">info@papie.org.</a>

<p class="bold12Blue">How can the local community support PiE?</p>

<p class="body10">The local community, including those without children currently in PAUSD schools, is vital to the
    success of PiE. Last year, individuals without children and businesses in the district directly contributed a total
    of $180,000 to PiE, exceeding PiE's Community Campaign goals. In addition, companies providing matching funds gave
    nearly $500,000 to PiE's campaign.</p>

<p class="body10">In addition, last year PiE launched its PiE Business Partners program, a chance for local businesses
    to support schools.

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">I'm unhappy with my individual teacher, principal, school board, or district
    staff; why should I give to PiE?</p>


<p class="body10">If you are upset with any aspect of your child's education, please
    communicate your concerns to your teacher, principal and/or superintendent.&nbsp; They
    all want to ensure your child has access to the best education possible, and is enjoying
    their school experience. Withholding a donation to PiE only increases the risk that
    essential staff will be cut. When we give to PiE, every child benefits.</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">What are PiE Teacher Grants?</p>

<p class="body10">Each year, PiE solicits applications from teachers for the Teacher Grant program, which supports
    innovation and
    collaboration in teaching. PiE’s goal for this year is to raise $100,000 to support excellence in teaching across
    the
    district. For more information about this program, please click <a
            href="../02_OurImpact/TeacherGrants.html">here</a>.</p>

<p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="bold12Blue">How can I get more involved with PiE?</p>

<p class="body10">There are many ways to become an active PiE supporter and volunteer.&nbsp;

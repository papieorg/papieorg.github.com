                                District (PAUSD) schools, and the only one whose contributions pay for additional and
                                much-needed PAUSD teachers and staff.&nbsp; We partner with parents, the school
                                district, and the community, to give all students the best education possible.</p>

                            <p class="body10">PiE's goal for the 2011-2012 Schools Campaign is to raise the funds needed
                                to support critical staffing and programs at Palo Alto schools.&nbsp; We hope to raise
                                $3.9 million for the Palo Alto Unified School District, a 14.7% increase from last
                                year's contribution.&nbsp; In addition to the large grant, PiE's goal for teacher grants
                                remains at $100,000. Each year, we work closely with PAUSD to set our fundraising goals,
                                to mitigate budget cuts and ensure continued excellence across district schools.&nbsp;
                                The funds we raise support carefully chosen target areas at each school level. (<a

                            <p class="body10">PiE dollars now make up well over half of the flexible funding that our
                                principals can spend at each school. These dollars fund classroom aides, arts, and
                                science in our elementary schools; classroom teacher coaches, counselors, and electives
                                enrichment in our middle schools; and student guidance, college and career counseling,
                                and career and technology-focused electives in our high schools.</p>

                            <p class="body10">Public financing alone can no longer provide the high quality education we
                                expect in our community.&nbsp; In order to maintain and build upon the academic
                                excellence of our schools, which draws families to our neighborhoods and keeps property
                                values high, we must seek additional funding.</p>

                            <p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="body10">California's ranking on per-student spending on education has steadily
                                decreased since the passage of Proposition 13, a consequence of the state's tax-reform
                                efforts.&nbsp; Two types of school classifications resulted from this funding reduction:
                                Basic Aid and Revenue Limited.&nbsp; Revenue Limited districts do not raise enough taxes
                                locally to meet the state minimums and therefore receive funding from the state based on
                                the number of students enrolled.&nbsp; Basic Aid districts (such as Palo Alto) are
                                perceived to have enough local tax revenue to meet minimum school funding and, thus,
                                receive relatively little state funding.</p>

                            <p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="body10">As a Basic Aid district, we must rely on the generosity of local donors
                                and ballot measures, in addition to federal and state funding, to augment property taxes
                                and support our school district's high standards of excellence.</p>

                            <p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

                                asking for money?</u></strong></p>

                            <p class="body10">&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="body10">PAUSD has won repeated awards for its outstanding financial management
                                from the state. The district is required by law to maintain a healthy and substantial
                                reserve to cover unforeseen expenses and shortfalls during fiscally challenging times.
                                Superintendent Skelly has told the community that the reserve will be drawn down over
                                the next few years as state and federal finances get tighter. Unfortunately, the kind of
                                educational program Palo Alto schools offer is no longer free. PiE funds the important
                                programs that the district can no longer support and needs donations to preserve crucial
                                staff like aides, counselors, electives and others. Your donations and the donations of
                                all community members allow Palo Alto schools to continue to offer the enriched
                                education that many other school districts have been forced to cut in recent years.</p>

                            <p class="body10">PiE is committed to an equitable distribution of funds across district
                                schools on a per-pupil basis per school level, so that all students benefit. In the
                                spring PiE sets its target goals for the following year, together with each school
                                principal, parents (through market research), and with input from the district.&nbsp;
                                Once these targets are set, principals work with their staff to allocate dollars
                                appropriately.&nbsp; PiE dollars directly support staff members that enrich education at
                                the individual school level and support broader educational priorities set forth by the
                                district's strategic plan. In addition, in the event of severe cuts from the state, PiE
                                may also give principals the flexibility to use some PiE funds to alleviate teacher
                                layoffs. PiE donations can be directed towards elementary schools, middle schools, high
                                schools, or remain unrestricted. PiE target areas for 2011-12 are:</p>

                                communicate your concerns to your teacher, principal and/or superintendent.&nbsp; They
                                all want to ensure your child has access to the best education possible, and is enjoying
                                their school experience. Withholding a donation to PiE only increases the risk that
                                essential staff will be cut. When we give to PiE, every child benefits.</p>

                        <p>For six Palo Alto students who recently exited their secure high school lives for unknown
                            futures in college, the news from the afterlife is good.</p>

                        <p>After surviving the intoxicating rush of the first semester of college – and all the
                            attention lavished on them by orientation, faculty mentors, freshman dorm communities and
                            events – most of them are having a wonderful experience. However, they all noted challenges
                            in figuring out the formula for success and happiness in college as they looked back on high
                            school.</p>

                        <p><strong>Melanie and Thomas Wade – &ldquo;Paly Prepared Us Well For College&rdquo;</strong>
                            <br>
                            For Paly 2012 graduates Melanie Wade and her twin brother Thomas Wade, their post-Paly
                            college experiences couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Melanie is an undeclared freshman at
                            the sprawling Seattle campus of University of Washington, where she is playing NCAA Division
                            1 volleyball in the competitive Pac10 league. Although she lives in a dorm, Melanie says she
                            has little time to befriend non-volleyball students or take advantage of &ldquo;cool things
                            like study abroad&rdquo; due to her unrelenting training schedule and travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;She
                            hopes to compensate by playing professional volleyball in Europe after graduation.</p>

                        <p>As a recruited athlete committing to Washington at the beginning of her junior year,
                            she &ldquo;could have coasted her junior and senior year,&rdquo; she says, but didn&rsquo;t,
                            and recommends that high school athletes take challenging courses in order to succeed in
                            college.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Paly&rsquo;s advanced courses prepared me very well for college,
                            but I also wish I&rsquo;d taken more regular lane classes and had more fun,&rdquo; she says,
                            suggesting that Paly students should enjoy high school more. &ldquo;Focus on your writing,&rdquo;
                            she states. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m loving my anthropology class, but have had to learn a
                            completely new way of writing for assignments that they don&rsquo;t teach at
                            Paly.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>At the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, her brother Thomas hones his vocal performance
                            technique in classical music and opera rehearsals while attending general education classes.
                            The conservatory&rsquo;s entire campus is&nbsp;one building with eight floors of practice
                            rooms and concert halls.&nbsp;&ldquo;Freshmen are housed in a &lsquo;faux dorm&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
                            really an urban apartment building near the school. I moved out after one quarter – too much
                            drama – now I&rsquo;m living in a shared-apartment on Nob Hill.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve grown up so
                            quickly. If I lose my key I have to deal with it like an adult – there&rsquo;s no campus
                            security.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have rehearsals and go out for coffee, not boozy frat parties.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s
                            like I&rsquo;m a working adult, living in San Francisco, and my job is performing and going
                            to classes,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I absolutely love it!!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Thomas also took AP classes at Paly and says the main benefit was learning how to manage his
                            time and get homework done when he got home from school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;There was such a
                            work ethic at Paly; you felt like everybody was&nbsp;<em>all in</em>&nbsp;about academics,&rdquo;
                            he recalled. &ldquo;College is easy compared to Paly. I have less work and more free time
                            now, but I&rsquo;m actually taking more classes than I did in high school and have better
                            grades. I over-worked myself at Paly.&rdquo;</p>

                            college choice after graduating from Paly in 2012. &ldquo;The key to making the college
                            application process painless is to start really early.    I started working on the Common App
                            essays the summer before senior year with a college counselor so I was able to keep my
                            grades up during my fall semester senior year.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>The business major resides in a VERY social freshman dorm at USC, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s also
                            clean, which is very important when it comes to dorms,&rdquo; he says. Fortunately, despite
                            USC&rsquo;s reputation for tough academics as well as great parties, Will said that Paly
                            prepared him well.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I took AP US History, four years of high lane math, AP Spanish and pretty
                            challenging courses at Paly and the courses are not harder here, there&rsquo;s just more
                            work,&rdquo; he says. After playing varsity tennis at Paly, Will is now focused on
                            intermural basketball, and advises students to explore more than one sport or
                            extra-curricular activity in high school while still getting good grades.</p>

                        <p><strong>Alice Rochette – &ldquo;Take Advantage of College Counselors&rdquo;</strong> <br>
                            2012 Gunn grad Alice Rochette loves the University of San Francisco (USF), and says it&rsquo;s
                            the perfect fit for her. Describing the college application process as &ldquo;very
                            stressful,&rdquo; Alice says that her PiE-funded Gunn counselor Ms. (Myesha) Compton was a
                            lifesaver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She&nbsp;was very helpful, patient and always explained
                            something twice if needed and helped me research schools and figure out what I needed to do,&rdquo;
                            she relates.</p>

                        <p>Alice was glad she made time to explore different clubs and activities at Gunn, including
                            theatre, gardening club and the Gay-Straight Alliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Looking back, I
                            wish I had taken more interesting classes at Gunn instead of prep periods and enjoyed high
                            school more,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;I was working so hard at Gunn I missed time I could have enjoyed with my friends or
                            really focused on my education. I was more worried about getting the good grade instead of
                            actually learning the content, if that makes sense,&rdquo; Alice explains. She says that
                            Gunn prepared her well for college math courses and the workload, but not for the freshman
                            English and rhetoric courses at USF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;College writing is a lot different
                            and is much harder than I imagined.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps if I&rsquo;d taken AP Lit at Gunn I
                            would have been more prepared, but I&rsquo;m not sure I could have handled another AP
                            course.&rdquo;</p>

                            Skills&rdquo;</strong> <br>
                            Carleton College freshman Ashley Shin shares Alice&rsquo;s assessment on the difficulty of
                            college writing and English. &ldquo;Despite Paly's intense academic rigor as a top high
                            school, the level of excellence expected at Carleton is extremely high,&rdquo; the 2012 Paly
                            grad says. &ldquo;Even though we only take 3 classes per trimester, it&rsquo;s more work
                            than I have time for.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Ashley is also playing volleyball at Carleton, but was admitted based on her academic
                            performance. &ldquo;You have to work three times as hard in a Carleton class as you did in
                            an AP class at Paly to&nbsp;receive&nbsp;a similar grade; however, due to all the fantastic,
                            intellectual&nbsp;conversations we have, I feel smarter just by being here,&rdquo; Ashley
                            says.&nbsp;&nbsp;She recommends having fun with extra-curricular activities, but really
                            focus on time management and study skills: &ldquo;That way you&rsquo;ll have time to
                            participate in all the really cool things there are to do at college.&rdquo;<br><br></p>

                            Recruited Athlete&rdquo;</strong> <br>
                            Gunn 2012 grad Paul Blanchette is also a recruited athlete who signed with Loyola Marymount
                            University (LMU) to play soccer in the fall of his junior year. Pual only played
                            soccer for Gunn his junior year, choosing instead to play for De Anza Force Academy to
                            develop his soccer skills. He applied only to LMU, after spending months talking to college
                            coaches and at recruiting events, finishing his college application in a single night.</p>

                        <p>Paul does not regret his decision. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect!&rdquo; Pual
                            says. &ldquo;I love the university&rsquo;s medium size, the weather, and being in small
                            classes where the professors know my name. As a recruited athlete, I only had to have a 3.0
                            GPA and a 1500 on my SAT to get into LMU, even though my GPA and test scores were higher.&rdquo;
                            Pual didn&rsquo;t take AP classes at Gunn. His outlook was &ldquo;not just to excel
                            academically. I took auto shop for two years and art, which was fun and relaxing and learned
                            how to draw,&rdquo; he says. The good news is that Pual says he is keeping up with his
                            fellow students in class.</p>
                        Paul advises being realistic about how hard you have to work at your sport year round to
                        be a recruited athlete. &ldquo;Do what you have to in order to get good grades, including
                        getting a tutor or extra help if you need it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;College is harder than high
                        school because you have to be much more self-motivated. No one tells you what to do with the
                        material.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no study guides, or Power Points to help you decipher how to
                        learn; you must figure out the professor&rsquo;s style and form of testing. It takes awhile to
                        be successful with grades in college.&rdquo;
